Laravel Boilerplate lets you create a Laravel based CMS with just few step of configuration.

* Web site: https://github.com/ludo237/laravel-boilerplate
* Support: http://wwww.twitter.com/ludo237
 
The purpose is to create a simple User Managment System with Laravel 4, because I think it is one of the best Framework
around at the moment, you should give it a try.
 
This system will be composed by:
- Front end made with "Foundation 4" by Zurb (http://foundation.zurb.com/).
- User sign up and sign in with profile management.
- Admin backend with user management.
- News feed, admin only, with Auth comments.
- Multilanguage supports (at least two: Italian and English)


If you want to contribute feel free to fork this project, pull requests and open issue tickets.

Hope you will enjoy with this.
